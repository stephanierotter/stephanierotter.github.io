## About me

Hi, my name is Stephanie Rotter. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the [CRC1412](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/de/) project on register and variation at the Humboldt University in Berlin. In the project, I investigate the [Register effects in discourse expectations: Negation and modality in English](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/projects/a07/). I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin).

Having a background in cognitive science and psycholinguistics, I combine theories from theoretical linguitics with approaches of psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics.
