## About me

Hi, my name is Stephanie Rotter. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the CRC1412 project on register at the Humboldt University in Berlin. In the project, I investigate the pragmatic functions and effects of register variation in the context of negation and polarity. I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin).

Having a background in Cognitive Science and Psycholinguistics, I combine theories from theoretical linguitics with approaches of psycholinguistics.
