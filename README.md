## About me

Hi, my name is Stephanie Rotter. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the CRC1412 project on register at the Humboldt University in Berlin. In the project, I investigate the pragmatic functions and effects of register variation in the context of negation and polarity. I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin).

Having a background in Cognitive Science and Psycholinguistics, I combine theories from theoretical linguitics with approaches of psycholinguistics 


I try to combine insights from theoretical linguistics, psycho-/neurolinguistics, and computational models for a better understanding of human natural language and its users. I am broadly interested in the semantics and pragmatics of natural language, and the cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing. Currently, my research focuses on language processing at the sentence and discourse level.
